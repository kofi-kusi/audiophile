## Overview

### The Challenge

Your users should be able to:

- [x] Add/Remove products from the cart
- [x] Edit product quantities in the cart
- [ ] Fill in all fields in the checkout
- [ ] Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- [x] See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
- [x] Shipping always adds $50 to the order
- [x] VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- [x] See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- [x] View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [ ] Bonus: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (localStorage could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
